            <p>
                WordPress(also known as WP or WordPress.org)is a 
                web content management system. 
                It was originally created as a tool to 
                publish blogs but has evolved to 
                support publishing other web content, 
                including more traditional websites...

                Joomla! is the only major CMS that is built entirely 
                by volunteers from all over the world. We have a strong 
                community bond and all take pleasure in building something 
                that has a large global impact. If you are interested in 
                volunteering please head over to the volunteer portal...
